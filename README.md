we have to use the arm compiler arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc 

current installation is located at /usr/bin 

gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi is the cross-toolchain package for the armel architecture. This toolchain implies the EABI generated by gcc's -mfloat-abi=soft or -mfloat-abi=softfp options.

gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf is the cross-toolchain package for the armhf architecture. This toolchain implies the EABI generated by the gcc -mfloat-abi=hard option.

To compile a  filename.c file 
arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc filename.c 

When compiling for a platform like ARM, itâ€™s usually also a good thing to create a statically linked binary. This means that the binary will not depend on dynamically linked libraries (which can be missing/broken dependencies).

arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc filename.c -o filename-arm -static
